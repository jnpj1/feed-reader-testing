## Project Overview

From Udacity: In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite.

Testing Implementations: Testing suites added to test functionality of feed array, sidebar menu, and ajax functions.
